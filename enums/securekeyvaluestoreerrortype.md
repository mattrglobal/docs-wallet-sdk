# Enumeration: SecureKeyValueStoreErrorType

Secure keystore functions and types

**`remarks`**
Secure keystore has had breaking changes between versions
We have exposed these functions and types to allow the consumer of the SDK to handle the migration manually.
Eventually, we will be able to remove these functions and types.
Until then, we have annotated with [https://typedoc.org/tags/ignore/](https://typedoc.org/tags/ignore/) ignore to prevent them being exposed in docs.
